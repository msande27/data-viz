# Week 3 - Getting Started with Data & Graphics
## Introduction
This class focuses on starting to understand the relationship between the data you are working with and the graphical output produced. Building a strong intuition about the manner in which data is translated visually is a critical skill for understanding graphs. Simple examples like bar charts, histograms, scatterplots, and pie charts serve as a foundation for far more complex visualizations. As this underlying graphical intuition grows, a visualizer will become more capable of creatively imagining graphing options.

## Portfolio Proposal
Due: Sunday, January 29, 11:59 pm Eastern Time

This assessment is worth 50 points, or 2.5 percent of your overall grade.

### Introduction

The portfolio proposal exists so students can research and choose a topic for the final portfolio that all further assignments (excluded the discussion boards) for this course will directly contribute to. Students must choose a single topic related to public policy to examine with a series of data driven visualizations. Researching and carefully selecting a topic early in the semester is critical to ensure that there is enough data available to create a diverse range of policy graphics. Take more space if you would like, but 300-500 words is a reasonable length.

### Directions

The portfolio proposal must include (1) the topic that will be examined; (2) a set of at least three data sources that are readily available to be used for creating graphs on this topic; and (3) a series of preliminary ideas about what types of graphs the final portfolio may include and what those graphs could feasibly show. Students should take time to ensure that the data sources used come from reputable organizations like national governments, non-profit think tanks, academic institutions, and unbiased media sources.

The most common problem that students encouter is a data shortage, so take time to ensure there is enough. If you're not sure, feel free to reach out to me to discuss. Also, you do not want to work on a project that requires data collection or waiting to obtain proprietary data. 

## Weekly Objective
By the end of this week, you will be able to:
Locate critical data sources for important public policy issues;
Design a data visualization portfolio plan.
