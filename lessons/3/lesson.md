# Week 3 - Getting Started with Data & Graphics
## Introduction
This class focuses on starting to understand the relationship between the data you are working with and the graphical output produced. Building a strong intuition about the manner in which data is translated visually is a critical skill for understanding graphs. Simple examples like bar charts, histograms, scatterplots, and pie charts serve as a foundation for far more complex visualizations. As this underlying graphical intuition grows, a visualizer will become more capable of creatively imagining graphing options.
